   		The story is loosely based on an event in Italy thirty years prior to the play's composition: the murder of Vittoria Accoramboni in Padua on 22 December 1585.</P> Webster's dramatisation of this event turned Italian corruption into a vehicle for depicting "the political and moral state of England in his own day",[1] particularly the corruption in the royal court.<P>
		<BR>The play explores the differences between the reality of people and the way they depict themselves as good, "white", or pure.</BR></P>
